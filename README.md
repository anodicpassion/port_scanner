# Port Scanner

## Overview
This project is a simple TCP port scanner built using Python's `socket` and `threading` libraries. It scans a given target IP address for open ports, which is a common network security technique.

## Features
- **TCP Port Scanning**: Scans specific or ranges of TCP ports on a target machine.
- **Multithreading**: Scans multiple ports simultaneously using multiple threads for faster results.

## How to Use

1. Run the script:
```bash
python3 port_scanner.py
